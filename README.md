I am creaing a teaching practice system it is an institution that leave here in my city 
the institution name is federal college of education, yola is an institution that trains teachers 
the train you on how to teach in a classroom and how to be a better teacher
federal college of education has different schools under it those school consists of:
1. school of sciences 
2. school of art and social sciences
3. school of law
4. school of languages
when we take for example school of sciences the teaches student science subjects such as biology, physics, chemistry and computer 
and also when we take *school of languages the train student different languages that we used here in the country such as fulani, 
igbo and hausa
i am going with school of sciences as an example
school of sciences has departments that are under it those department consists of biology, physics, chemistry and computer 
the are all under school of sciences as the are science subjects so each of those department that i have listed have there 
own lecturers biology have lecturers, computer have and also chemistry have lecturers in there departments
as a student when you come to your final year the school authority "federal college of education. yola "
will send you into various primary and secondary school that is within the community with the aim of making you a better teacher
the normally give you a paper to fill up your name , gender and also you are to choose  a primary or secondary school on your wish that you are going into the class and practice what you have been taugh
so there is a commitee in the college that are responsible for accepting or rejecting the primary or secondary school that you have applied for the can also changed you to another school if the number of you have exit 20 in a school
so also the divide the number of student into 3 categories which is label as A, B and C so i am taking whatsapp as a primary school. so 12 students applied for whatsapp primary school now the commitee will categories those 12 students into three groups group A=4, B=4 and C=4
making 12 so the are going to place the students name in a notice board and the school that he was posted on and also the group he blog to either A, B or C
So the problem that i facing is about there outing You see the staffs  are going to six outings 1,2,3,4,5, and 6 and each outing for example if we take first outing the are going to five school it may be less that 5 may be 2 or 1 but it will never be above 5
Thats for the primary and secondary school
Normally the students that are gone to the primary and secondary school to teach the will spend six months so for each month the are going to get one of there College staff that will visit them and also score them based on there performance
What i done so far is that
I create where the admin will add all the primary and secondary schools within the community so when student comes all what he need do is to choose the school we wants to go and teach
In the admin panel i also create where staffs details will be added so that when it comes to posting he will just choose the school in the college that the staff it is and also choose the department that the staff it is then choose the primary or secondary school that he wants to give the staff to go for review
Also choose a group that the staff will go for review either A,B or C
So now the problem is how would i structure the database and also how would i create the code
Since each staff must go to six outings thats why in the picture i send to you before i create a drop down menu that contains 1-6 outings So now the database  am i going to create bunch of them  will be atleast 30 in number since in the future i am going to fetch them out
For example the database will be f1, f2, f3, f4,f5,s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,fo1,fo2,fo3,fo4,fo5,fi1,fi2,fi3,fi4,fi5,si1,si2,si3,si4,si5
Fi stands for first outing s stands for second outing thats up to the end
So that when we choose mr solomon and we give  him as he is going to facebook primary school as his first school for first outing and he is going for group A and in the outing we choose first and click save now the data should saved in f1 since it is first outing and if we repeat thesame step for thesame staff mr solomon and we repeat the same process by giving mr solomon whatsapp secondary school as his second school for first outing and we give him group C and we still choose first outing since it is the second school for the first outing now  instead of saving in f1 it should save in f2 since we already post him in first school
Or if the code can be able to detect if we choose first outing and click saved it should saved in f1 and if we repeat thesame process but adding the second school for thesame staff it should check if f1 contains data it should saved in f2 and if it reaches f5 for the first outing it should alert limit reach nothing will saved unless he choose either second outing for other outing
